# Iris Flower Classification

This project aims to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and consists of 150 samples, where each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The samples are labeled with one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

Project Overview:

The project uses logistic regression as the classification algorithm to train a model on the Iris dataset.
The dataset is preprocessed to separate the features (sepal and petal measurements) and the target variable (flower species).
The data is then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
The logistic regression model is trained on the training data and used to make predictions on the test data.
The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels.
Finally, the trained model can be used to classify new iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.
